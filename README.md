### How to use this repo
All scripts can be found in `package.json` under `scripts`. The two you really need to care about are `dev` and `lint`.

`dev`: Creates a localhost instance of your website, running on one of your ports. If you visit that localhost port in your browser, your website will pop up.
`lint`: Checks for issues in your repo, from bugs to style issues.

You can run either by prepending `npm run <script>` to them. For example, `npm run dev` run the `dev` script.

1. Briefly describe everything you've added on from the starter template. 

I added descriptions of myself and my contact information.

I want my website visitor to think that my favorite color is pink and that I like cute things. I hope to accomplish this by adding a pastel pink theme to my website along with adding drawings of some of my favorite characters (pusheen, sumikko gurashi, etc.). 

3. What's your favorite part of the website you've made? What needs improvement? 

I'm glad I got the description of myself done, but I definitely need more time to work on all of the pages to make it fit my aesthetic.
