## !! READ BEFORE STARTING !!
You'll need Node.js 20.9+ for this repo to work. Visit https://nodejs.org to install it on your machine if you haven't already. You can run `node -v` in your terminal to check if it is already installed.

This repo uses `npm` for package management. This should be installed along with Node.js. Run `npm -v` to ensure it is installed.

The teck stack for the website is React + Next.js using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It also uses a linter, ESLint, for style-checking.

### How to use this repo
All scripts can be found in `package.json` under `scripts`. The two you really need to care about are `dev` and `lint`.

`dev`: Creates a localhost instance of your website, running on one of your ports. If you visit that localhost port in your browser, your website will pop up.
`lint`: Checks for issues in your repo, from bugs to style issues.

You can run either by prepending `npm run <script>` to them. For example, `npm run dev` run the `dev` script.
